# Constructive-Social-choice
This
work addresses the problem of social choice from a constructive recommendation perspective (i.e recommending/choosing an outcome or a decision for a group by jointly eliciting
personal preferences of individuals in a group generating entirely novel instances and recommending an instance that maximizes some notion of consensus among the group).
