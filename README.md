# Constructive-Social-choice
This
work addresses the problem of social choice from a constructive recommendation perspective (i.e recommending/choosing an outcome or a decision for a group by jointly eliciting
personal preferences of individuals in a group generating entirely novel instances and recommending an instance that maximizes some notion of consensus among the group).

The work is done as an extension of the Constructive Preference Elicitation for Multiple Users with Setwise Max-margin. Checkout the social choise branch of [Setmargin project](https://github.com/stefanoteso/musm-adt17/tree/socialchoice)
